* 1.6   Oct 2011
    - complete Windows/Visual Studio compatibility (thanks Martin Paljak, Ludovic Rousseau, Viktor Tarasov)
    - fix crash when list_delete_range() is used to clear the entire list (thanks Armando Miraglia)
    - fix list_hash() possibly returning inconsistent values
    /*****      API CHANGES     *****/
    - list_dump_info_t:
        "timestamp" type changes from "int64_t" to "struct timeval" for compatibility with old compilers
        the binary format of dumps is affected, v1.6 dumps/restores ARE NOT COMPATIBLE with older versions.
    - list_delete_range() and list_clear():
        really return the number of elements deleted on success instead of 0 as described by documentation
    - list_dump_file() and list_restore_file():
        really return 0 instead of the size dumped/restored as described by documentation

    - improve performance of list_init() (thanks L. Rousseau)
    - fix assert() failure up to mid pointer not NULLed on cleared lists (thanks L. Rousseau)

* 1.4.2 Mar 2009
    - make return values of list_dump_file() and list_restore_file() consistent
